\section{Heuristic}

The heuristic consist of two stages: The \emph{context collection} stage and the \emph{candidate detection} stage. They are explained separately in the following.

\subsection{Context Collection}

During execution of the program in question, the modified SOMns interpreter dynamically counts the number of activations for each AST node. In this, it also takes the Java type of the activation result into account. Consider, for example, the following code snippet:
\begin{verbatim}
value:: value + 1
\end{verbatim}
which will be parsed into an AST similar to the following:
\begin{verbatim}
LocalVariableWriteNode
  EagerBinaryPrimitiveNode
    LocalVariableReadNode
    IntegerLiteralNode
    AdditionPrim
\end{verbatim}
We now assume that the \textsf{value} slot stores a numeric value represented by a Java \textsf{Long} and consider a program run in which the \textsf{LocalVariableReadNode} is activated 100 times. During execution, the dynamic analysis records the fact that the \textsf{LocalVariableReadNode} has been activated 100 times, each time producing a \textsf{Long} value. This dynamic analysis is implemented in the \textsf{tools.dym.nodes.TypeCountingNode} and \textsf{tools.dym.profiles.TypeCounter} classes.

After execution, the analysis constructs a set of so-called \emph{activation contexts}. An activation context consists of two parts, a \emph{trace} and a \emph{type}, and is implemented in \textsf{tools.dym.superinstructions.ActivationContext}.

The \emph{type} denotes the Java type of the node activation result. A \emph{trace} is a sequence of strings and integers and has the general form
\begin{align*}
[ C_0, s_0, C_1, ..., s_{n - 1}, C_{n}]
\end{align*}
in which all $C_k$ are Java node class names and all $s_k$ are child slot indices. A trace represents the environment in which a node was activated. The rightmost node class name (i.e. $C_n$) is the class name of the activated node. Its preceding node class name $C_{n-1}$ denotes its parent AST node and $s_{n-1}$ denotes the child slot in which the activated node is located. This construction is continued extended up to a predefined length.

Instances of \textsf{EagerPrimitive} nodes are handled separately: Here, the heuristic constructs an artificial node class from the operation name, e.g.\ an \textsf{EagerBinaryPrimitiveNode} node with an addition primitive is denoted as \textsf{PrimitiveOperation:+}.

In my heuristic, I construct traces up to $n=2$. Thus, for the \textsf{LocalVariableReadNode} in the exemplary AST, the following activation contexts are constructed:

\begin{verbatim}
ActivationContext(type=Long, trace=[LocalVariableReadNode])
ActivationContext(type=Long, trace=[PrimitiveOperation:+, 0,
                                    LocalVariableReadNode])
ActivationContext(type=Long, trace=[LocalVariableWriteNode, 0,
                                    PrimitiveOperation:+, 0,
                                    LocalVariableReadNode])
\end{verbatim}

Each activation context is annotated with its number of activations. In the example, all three activation contexts are annotated with $100$ (because the corresponding \textsf{LocalVariableReadNode} was activated 100 times). The context collector is implemented in \textsf{tools.dym.superinstructions.ContextCollector}.

The result of the context collection stage is a map mapping activation contexts to activation counts.

\subsection{Candidate Detection}



\section{Superinstructions}

\subsection{Increment Operation}

The superinstruction \sinst{increment} represents the increment of a local \textsf{Long} variable by a fixed integer.
In other words, the following subtree:
